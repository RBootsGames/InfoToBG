---------- v 1.5.4 --------
* Clicking the power settings button will create a batch file in the startup folder which will close the sysprep window on boot.
* Reworked the opacity slider to no longer use a third-party DLL. (Should help with load speeds.)

---------- v 1.5.3 --------
* The power setting button will now actually disable sleeping on lid close.

---------- v 1.5.2 --------
* Fixed toggle button image for touchscreen.
* Hopefully fixed the power settings button.
* Changing the opacity bar no longer applies the background if one hasn't been generated yet.
* Turning on the SSD option now applies it to the smallest drive if multiple are installed.
* Storage drives and GPU VRAM now store capacity as byte count instead of already converted GB or TB.
* Fixed the debug file not being added to or used.
* Can now run the program while the flash drive has been disconnected.
* Certain GPUs will no longer have multiple spaces in the name.
* Setting the screen size to 0 will exclude information about the screen.

---------- v 1.5.1 --------
* Redesigned everything.
* Added button to set power settings.
* Created Custom controls for the wallpaper selectors.

---------- v 1.5.0 --------
* Fixed: If a custom addition was added then removed and 'update' was clicked, the changes wouldn't get saved.
* Fixed: When selecting a different wallpaper, if it was a different vertical resolution it wouldn't add the information centered vertically until it was updated.
* Fixed: If SSD is checked and there are multiple drives it will label them all as an SSD.
* Added a tooltip to the custom wallpaper button.
* If you click the update button before running an initial scan, it will create a new scan.
* Resolution will be based on total pixel count now. (Some monitors will have weird resolution settings so this should fix that.)
* Added antialiasing for the text, so it should look slightly prettier.
* Added our new Comprenew background as the default wallpaper.
* Rewrote how to information overlay is created to simplify moving it to different locations. (but you don't care about that)
* Added the ability to align the overlay to the left or the right of the screen.
* If you are changing the wallpaper or opacity, the overlay is no longer re-generated from scratch. This should make it unnoticeably faster.

	- it detects all possible resolutions that are supported and takes the highest value

---------- v 1.2 ----------
* changelog can now actually be opened
* added checkbox for mini displayport
* added more possible names for webcams in hopes to catch more of them automatically
